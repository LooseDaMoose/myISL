This repository is a simple container for notes and R code concerning the great book Introduction to Statistical Learning.
The e-version of the book is available for free [here][1]

[1]: <http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/> "Introduction to Stastical Learning"

Each chapter has a separate folder with notes(in PDF) and R code.
The notes are a selection of original text from ISL with additions here and there.
The code, from lab and exercise sections of the book, is stored in R notebooks.


## Required Libraries

To run the R notebooks you will need some non-standard R libraries:

* tidyverse
* ISLR
* ggplot2
* reshape2
